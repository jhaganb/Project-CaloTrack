<!--Title of the Project-->
# FOOD CLASSIFICATION AND CALORIES ESTIMATION WITH DEVELOPMENT OF SMART WEB-APPLICATION

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
This project is about Fruits-Vegetable classification. It is a simple web application that every user can use it. User need to upload the Image of any fruit or vegetable. Our system will automatically classify the Image and it will give you the prediction about the name of fruit or vegetable, and another module which will give you the calories of the predicted object. This is web application, so user can directly use it in any browser.

## Tools and Library 
<!--List the Tools and Library of the project as shown below-->

* Keras -- We are using for deep learning tasks like creating model, predicting the object etc.

* Pillow -- Pillow we are using for preprocessing the images of our dataset.

* Streamlit -- It is backend framework for developing the web application. 

* Beautifulsoup, Requests -- We are using it for scraping the calories from the internet for the predicted object.

* Numpy -- We are using it for the Image matrix handling

## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
* Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
* Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow for model training, MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition.
* Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is essential for efficient image processing and real-time hand gesture recognition.
* Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
* IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
* Additional Dependencies: Includes scikit-learn, TensorFlow (versions 2.4.1), TensorFlow GPU, OpenCV, and Mediapipe for deep learning tasks.

## System Architecture
<!--Embed the system architecture diagram as shown below-->
We are using the MobilenetV2 architecture. MobileNetV2 is a convolutional neural network architecture that seeks to perform well on mobile devices. It is based on an inverted residual structure where the residual connections are between the bottleneck layers. Mobilenet support any input size greater than 32 x 32
